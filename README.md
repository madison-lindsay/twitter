This is the beginning of a Twitter API project, using the NLTK library and networks.
* Classifies tweets from the New York Times vs from the Onion using random forest
* Assesses positivity of sets of tweets by search query and by user
* Assess positivity of emojis from their surrounding text

To Do:
* Create my own sensitivity analysis scores
